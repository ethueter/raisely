            provided, I have decided that I would really like this job. But that
            was not what was asked of me so here are my selections:

        <Item.Group>
          <Header as="h3">Two things I am excited about:</Header>

                    <Item.Description>
                        I love to get to the root of a problem and figure out a
                        solution. It is one of the main reasons I chose to pursue a
                        career in software development. The opportunity to work with
                        developers and to learn from them while solving real world
                        problems is very exciting to me.

                    <Item.Description>
                        It is exciting for me to help someone get set up and started on
                        a the right foot. By getting set up correcting in the beginning
                        helps limit issues down the road and increases customer
                        satisfaction.

                    <Item.Description>
                        I am eager to learn and take part in the lifecycle of new
                        features. This would help me achieve two goals, improving
                        customer experience with the products and my experience with
                        software development.

                    <Item.Description>
                        While I have experience creating content for social platforms, I
                        would like to learn how to improve in that area. Also interested
                        to learn about tools to coordinate campaigns across different
                        platforms.

                    <Item.Description>
                        I feel each customerâ€™s situation is unique and that I would
                        prefer to train them individually. That said if there is a
                        significant amount of boilerplate set up that could speed up
                        training then I would interested in putting that together.

                        I am not sure anyone really wants to engage with angry/upset
                        people much less your customers. But I have, extensive
                        experience doing it and I am confident in my ability to calm
                        people and help guide them to a solution.
