                  I love to get to the root of a problem and figure out a
                  solution. It is one of the main reasons I chose to pursue a
                  career in software development. The opportunity to work with
                  developers and to learn from them while solving real world
                  problems is very exciting to me.

                  It is exciting for me to help someone get set up and started
                  down the right path. This helps limit issues down the road and
                  increases customer satisfaction. Also, specific customer needs
                  help test the boundaries of a program and can lead to the
                  development of new features.

                  I am eager to learn and take part in the lifecycle of new

                  customer experience with the products and my experience with
                  software development.

                  I feel each customerâ€™s situation is unique and I would
                  prefer to train them individually. That said if there is a
                  significant amount of boilerplate set up that could speed up
                  training, then I would be interested in putting that together.
